# Mexe-mexe

This is a program I developed specifically for Mexe-mexe, a card game I play with my grandparents. The point of the program is simple: given a current state of the game, determine if a given card can fit with the others already on the table. Right now I have a simple GUI for inputing the cards on the table and asking if a card can fit.
