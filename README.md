# Mexe-mexe

This is a program I developed specifically for Mexe-mexe, a card game I play with my grandparents. The point of the program is simple: given a current state of the game, determine if a given card can fit with the others already on the table, following specific rules of the game. I initially developed it with a GUI, but now I mostly use the CLI version

# Compilation

Dependency (for the GUI): `tkinter 8.6`
Simply run:
`python mexe-mexeCLI.py` or `python mexe-mexeGUI.py
